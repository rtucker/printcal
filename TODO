* Use a better incrementer to search for calendar entries
  Right now, it pulls a whole glomp.  This sucks and is slow,
  and adapts poorly to calendars of various sizes.

* Integrate todos and calendar entries
  Make it day-based instead of event-based

* Improved output format
  Some nice graphical PDF might be cool
